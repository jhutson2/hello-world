    <h1>Hello, World! What's crackin!</h1>
    <p>from what i read in
    <a href="http://blog.froont.com/brief-history-of-web-design-for-designers/">
       the history of web design</a>,
        it seems as though over time as new ways of
      writing were created the simpler it became for developers to write. Developers seemed to dislike
      the interface. As developers made new interfaces to help create sharper and nicer designs the new
       languages became more popular. Then as technology started making the switch into smart phones flash
        became more popular. I believe flash will steadily become popular like Java. It will eventually
         encompass all of the material that will also be in watches.
<P>
    I see smart watches becoming the way of the future. We will rely on them the
     same way we do as phones.
    I can see smart watches taking place as the
    new way of instant messaging and will eventually take the place of some computers.
